{"latex": "Ten gamblers start playing with the same amount of money. In turn they cast five dice. If the dice show a total of $n$, the player must pay each other player $\\frac{1}{n}$ times the sum which that player owns at the moment. They throw and pay one after the other. At the $10^{\\text{th}}$ round (i.e. after each player has cast the five die once), the dice shows a total of $12$ and after the payment it turns out that every player has exactly the same sum as he had in the beginning. Is it possible to determine the totals shown by the dice at the nine former rounds?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h411865p2311824", "category": ""}
