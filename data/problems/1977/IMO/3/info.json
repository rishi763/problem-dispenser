{"latex": "Let $n$ be a given number greater than 2. We consider the set $V_n$ of all the integers of the form $1 + kn$ with $k = 1, 2, \\ldots$ A number $m$ from $V_n$ is called indecomposable in $V_n$ if there are not two numbers $p$ and $q$ from $V_n$ so that $m = pq.$ Prove that there exist a number $r \\in V_n$ that can be expressed as the product of elements indecomposable in $V_n$ in more than one way. (Expressions which differ only in order of the elements of $V_n$ will be considered the same.)", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h61031p367407", "category": ""}
