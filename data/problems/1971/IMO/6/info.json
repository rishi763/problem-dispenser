{"latex": "Let $ A = (a_{ij})$, where $ i,j = 1,2,\\ldots,n$, be a square matrix with all $ a_{ij}$ non-negative integers. For each $ i,j$ such that $ a_{ij} = 0$, the sum of the elements in the $ i$th row and the $ j$th column is at least $ n$. Prove that the sum of all the elements in the matrix is at least $ \\frac {n^2}{2}$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h60831p366683", "category": ""}
