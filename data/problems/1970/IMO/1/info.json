{"latex": "$M$ is any point on the side $AB$ of the triangle $ABC$. $r,r_1,r_2$ are the radii of the circles inscribed in $ABC,AMC,BMC$. $q$ is the radius of the circle on the opposite side of $AB$ to $C$, touching the three sides of $AB$ and the extensions of $CA$ and $CB$. Similarly, $q_1$ and $q_2$. Prove that $r_1r_2q=rq_1q_2$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h60833p366686", "category": "G"}
