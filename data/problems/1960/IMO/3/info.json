{"latex": "In a given right triangle $ABC$, the hypotenuse $BC$, of length $a$, is divided into $n$ equal parts ($n$ and odd integer). Let $\\alpha$ be the acute angel subtending, from $A$, that segment which contains the mdipoint of the hypotenuse. Let $h$ be the length of the altitude to the hypotenuse fo the triangle.
