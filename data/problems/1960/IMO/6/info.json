{"latex": "Consider a cone of revolution with an inscribed sphere tangent to the base of the cone. A cylinder is circumscribed about this sphere so that one of its bases lies in the base of the cone. let $V_1$ be the volume of the cone and $V_2$ be the volume of the cylinder.\\\\\n\\\\\na) Prove that $V_1 \\neq V_2$;\\\\\n\\\\\nb) Find the smallest number $k$ for which $V_1=kV_2$; for this case, construct the angle subtended by a diamter of the base of the cone at the vertex of the cone.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h54832p341560", "category": "G"}
