{"latex": "In tetrahedron $ABCD$, vertex $D$ is connected with $D_0$, the centrod if $\\triangle ABC$. Line parallel to $DD_0$ are drawn through $A,B$ and $C$. These lines intersect the planes $BCD, CAD$ and $ABD$ in points $A_2, B_1,$ and $C_1$, respectively. Prove that the volume of $ABCD$ is one third the volume of $A_1B_1C_1D_0$. Is the result if point $D_o$ is selected anywhere within $\\triangle ABC$?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h55978p346935", "category": "G"}
