{"latex": "A circle is inscribed in a triangle $ABC$ with sides $a,b,c$. Tangents to the circle parallel to the sides of the triangle are contructe. Each of these tangents cuts off a triagnle from $\\triangle ABC$. In each of these triangles, a circle is inscribed. Find the sum of the areas of all four inscribed circles (in terms of $a,b,c$).", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h55972p346921", "category": ""}
