{"latex": "An arbitrary point $M$ is selected in the interior of the segment $AB$. The square $AMCD$ and $MBEF$ are constructed on the same side of $AB$, with segments $AM$ and $MB$ as their respective bases. The circles circumscribed about these squares, with centers $P$ and $Q$, intersect at $M$ and also at another point $N$. Let $N'$ denote the point of intersection of the straight lines $AF$ and $BC$.\\\\\n\\\\\na) Prove that $N$ and $N'$ coincide;\\\\\n\\\\\nb) Prove that the straight lines $MN$ pass through a fixed point $S$ independent of the choice of $M$;\\\\\n\\\\\nc) Find the locus of the midpoints of the segments $PQ$ as $M$ varies between $A$ and $B$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h54823p341530", "category": ""}
