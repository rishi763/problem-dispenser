{"latex": "Suppose $ \\,G\\,$ is a connected graph with $ \\,k\\,$ edges. Prove that it is possible to label the edges $ 1,2,\\ldots ,k\\,$ in such a way that at each vertex which belongs to two or more edges, the greatest common divisor of the integers labeling those edges is equal to 1.\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{Note: Graph-Definition}. A \\textbf{graph} consists of a set of points, called vertices, together with a set of edges joining certain pairs of distinct vertices. Each pair of vertices $ \\,u,v\\,$ belongs to at most one edge. The graph $ G$ is connected if for each pair of distinct vertices $ \\,x,y\\,$ there is some sequence of vertices $ \\,x = v_{0},v_{1},v_{2},\\cdots ,v_{m} = y\\,$ such that each pair $ \\,v_{i},v_{i + 1}\\;(0\\leq i < m)\\,$ is joined by an edge of $ \\,G$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h60727p366446", "category": ""}
