(Intersecting circles are said to be orthogonal if at either common point their tangents are perpendicuar. Thus, proving that the circumcircles of the triangles $ACD$ and $BCD$ are orthogonal is equivalent to proving that the tangents to the circumcircles of the triangles $ACD$ and $BCD$ at the point $C$ are perpendicular.)", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h14096p99766", "category": ""}
