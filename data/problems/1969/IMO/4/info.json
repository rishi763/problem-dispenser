{"latex": "$C$ is a point on the semicircle diameter $AB$, between $A$ and $B$. $D$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $C$ to $AB$. The circle $K_1$ is the incircle of $ABC$, the circle $K_2$ touches $CD,DA$ and the semicircle, the circle $K_3$ touches $CD,DB$ and the semicircle. Prove that $K_1,K_2$ and $K_3$ have another common tangent apart from $AB$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h60053p363657", "category": ""}
