{"latex": "$G$ is a set of non-constant functions $f$. Each $f$ is defined on the real line and has the form $f(x)=ax+b$ for some real $a,b$. If $f$ and $g$ are in $G$, then so is $fg$, where $fg$ is defined by $fg(x)=f(g(x))$. If $f$ is in $G$, then so is the inverse $f^{-1}$. If $f(x)=ax+b$, then $f^{-1}(x)= \\frac{x-b}{a}$. Every $f$ in $G$ has a fixed point (in other words we can find $x_f$ such that $f(x_f)=x_f$. Prove that all the functions in $G$ have a common fixed point.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h58573p357910", "category": ""}
