{"latex": "Given the tetrahedron $ABCD$ whose edges $AB$ and $CD$ have lengths $a$ and $b$ respectively. The distance between the skew lines $AB$ and $CD$ is $d$, and the angle between them is $\\omega$. Tetrahedron $ABCD$ is divided into two solids by plane $\\epsilon$, parallel to lines $AB$ and $CD$. The ratio of the distances of $\\epsilon$ from $AB$ and $CD$ is equal to $k$. Compute the ratio of the volumes of the two solids obtained.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h56128p347428", "category": "G"}
