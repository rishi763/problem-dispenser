{"latex": "In a plane a set of $n\\geq 3$ points is given. Each pair of points is connected by a segment. Let $d$ be the length of the longest of these segments. We define a diameter of the set to be any connecting segment of length $d$. Prove that the number of diameters of the given set is at most $n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h56131p347432", "category": ""}
