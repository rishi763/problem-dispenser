{"latex": "Consider a plane $\\epsilon$ and three non-collinear points $A,B,C$ on the same side of $\\epsilon$; suppose the plane determined by these three points is not parallel to $\\epsilon$. In plane $\\epsilon$ take three arbitrary points $A',B',C'$. Let $L,M,N$ be the midpoints of segments $AA', BB', CC'$; Let $G$ be the centroid of the triangle $LMN$. (We will not consider positions of the points $A', B', C'$ such that the points $L,M,N$ do not form a triangle.) What is the locus of point $G$ as $A', B', C'$ range independently over the plane $\\epsilon$?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h55226p343318", "category": "G"}
